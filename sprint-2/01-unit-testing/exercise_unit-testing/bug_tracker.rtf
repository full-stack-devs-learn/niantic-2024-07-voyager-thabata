\f1 \
\
        
\f0\b Where was the bug? (function, line number):
\f1\b0  
\f2 getPerimeter(), line 52
\f1 \
\
        
\f0\b What test helped you find the bug?
\f1\b0

\f1\b0 \
\

\f0\b \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 Describe the bug/error:\'a0 
\f2\b0 missing the constructor and values for studentName and possiblePoints, set to 0 so we can change the value, after a lot of trial and error I realized having it hard set to 100 was a bad idea. And studentName was set to \'93Student\'94 for testing purposes.

\f1\b0 \

\f0\b \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 Describe the bug/error: 
\f2\b0 result was an int so it was coming back as 0 instead of 0.73\

\f1 \

\f0\b \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 Where was the bug? (function, line number): 
\f2\b0 getPercent(), line 43\'a0
\f1 \

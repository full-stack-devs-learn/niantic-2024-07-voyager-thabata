\f0\b Describe the bug/error:
\f1\b0  
\f2 Perimeter is calculated as 2*(width + height), and not just width + height.
\f1 \
\
        
\f0\b Where was the bug? (function, line number):
\f1\b0  
\f2 line 52, return statement was incorrectly calculating the perimeter of a rectangle.
\f1 \
\
        
\f0\b What test helped you find the bug?
